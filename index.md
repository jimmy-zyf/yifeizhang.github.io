## About Me

Welcome! I'm Yifei Zhang, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Emory University](https://www.cs.emory.edu/home/), where I have the fortune of working with [Dr. Liang Zhao](http://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/index.htm). Before this, I obtained my M.S. degree in Data Science from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) and my B.E. degree in Engineering Mechanics from [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/). Additionally, I earned a Master of Engineering Management degree from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/).

My research encompasses Explainable AI, Natural Language Processing, and Applied Machine Learning. I hold a strong academic background and have contributed to multiple research projects, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the data science field.

I have been actively looking for *research scientist* or *applied scientist* internship positions in <span style="color:lightpink;font-weight:bold">Summer ~~2024~~ 2025</span>. Feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities!

## Research Interests

- **Explainable AI:** Visual Explanation-guided Learning (Evaluating and Correcting the Reasoning of AI models)
- **Machine Learning:** Weakly-Supervised Learning, Multi-modal Learning
- **Natural Language Processing:** Multimodal Large Language Model, Explanation-guided Learning with Language Model
