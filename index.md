## About Me

Welcome! I'm Yifei Zhang, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Emory University](https://www.cs.emory.edu/home/), where I am fortunately working with Professor [Liang Zhao](http://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/index.htm). Prior to that, I obtained my M.S. Degree in Data Science from Columbia University and B.E. Degree in Engineering Mechanics from Dalian University of Technology. I also earned a Master of Engineering Management (MEM) degree from Duke University.

My research encompasses Explainable AI, Natural Language Processing, and Applied Machine Learning. I hold a strong academic background and have contributed to multiple research projects, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the data science field.

I have been actively looking for *research scientist* or *machine learning engineer* internship positions in <span style="color:lightpink;font-weight:bold">Summer 2024</span>. Feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities!

## Research Interests

- **Explainable AI:** Visual Explanation-guided Learning (Evaluating and Correcting the Reasoning of AI models)
- **Machine Learning:** Weakly Supervised Learning, Multi-modal Learning
- **Natural Language Processing:** Applications of Large Language Model, Explanation-guided Learning with Language Model
