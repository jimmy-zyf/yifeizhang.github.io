## About Me

Welcome! I'm Yifei Zhang, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Emory University](https://www.cs.emory.edu/home/), where I have the fortune of working with [Dr. Liang Zhao](http://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/index.htm). Before this, I obtained my M.S. Degree in Data Science from Columbia University and my B.E. Degree in Engineering Mechanics from Dalian University of Technology. Additionally, I earned a Master of Engineering Management (MEM) degree from Duke University.

My research encompasses Explainable AI, Natural Language Processing, and Applied Machine Learning. I hold a strong academic background and have contributed to multiple research projects, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the data science field.

I have been actively looking for *research scientist* or *data scientist* internship positions in <span style="color:lightpink;font-weight:bold">Summer 2024</span>. Feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities!

## Research Interests

- **Explainable AI:** Visual Explanation-guided Learning (Evaluating and Correcting the Reasoning of AI models)
- **Machine Learning:** Weakly-Supervised Learning, Multi-modal Learning
- **Natural Language Processing:** Applications of Large Language Model, Explanation-guided Learning with Language Model
